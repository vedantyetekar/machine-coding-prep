          The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows. It’s a very mean and nasty
          place, and I don’t care how tough you are, it will beat you to your
          knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody
          is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain’t about how hard you hit.
          It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much
          you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done! Now
          if you know what you’re worth, then go out and get what you’re worth,
          but you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers
          saying you ain’t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or
          anybody. Cowards do that and that ain’t you! You’re better than that!
